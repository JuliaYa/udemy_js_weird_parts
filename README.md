# JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts

These are my notes from this course.

### **First**.
JS falsely looks like other programming languages (Java, C#). But it is nothing lke those languages. JS is a different concept, a different mindset, a different paradigm.
### **Second**
Don't imitate, UNDERSTAND
### **Third**
If you use and read only examples without truly understanding you'll got problems when you need to write code from scratch or solve unusual problem. Language is just a tool and your need to deeply understand it.

After this course you'll be able to understand source code from different frameworks and libraries.
